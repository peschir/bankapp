=======

Little personal bank web application that show my account and stock overview of my 
bank account. The data is fetched from the bank account web site and it is only run local
because of security constraints by passing my bank account login data. 

The project is split in a display  and import bank data module. So the display part can run on the web 
but the import part should only be run localy because of the previous mentioned security constrain.
